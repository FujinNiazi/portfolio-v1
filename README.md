# Portfolio Website V1

This is a custom portfolio website I built to display my skills and experience. And my first dive into web development.

Its built using a **react app** with **Sass** for stlying. You can access it [here](https://fujinniazi.github.io/portfolio-v1/). *(right-click to open in a new tab)*

As I was using this as an oppurtunity to learn and gaining inspiration from other portfolios I tried to integrate different features. <br>
Some examples of which are:

 ## Animations
| Static                            | Dynamic                          |

However, including all these feautures (and then some) and not structuring it properly made making any changes to the code base really difficult and prone to breaking.

Thus to address a lot of these issues I'm planning to make a second version.
